- React-Redux is a package that allows the two to interact with each other.
- Provider is one of the key features of react-redux that wraps the react app, and grants access to the redux store and dispatch 
    functions throughout the component tree. Provider takes two props, the Redux store and the React child component of the app:
        <Provider store={store}>    \\ ReactAndRedux.js
            <App/>
        </Provider>
