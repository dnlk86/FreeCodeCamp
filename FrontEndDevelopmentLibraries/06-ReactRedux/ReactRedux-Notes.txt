- React-Redux is a package that allows the two to interact with each other.
- Provider is one of the key features of react-redux that wraps the react app, and grants access to the redux store and dispatch 
    functions throughout the component tree. Provider takes two props, the Redux store and the React child component of the app:
        <Provider store={store}>    \\ ReactAndRedux.js
            <App/>
        </Provider>
- mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() as the names suggest are the functions responsible for mapping state and dispatch provided
    by redux with props in react.
- Behind the scenes, React Redux uses the store.subscribe() method to implement mapStateToProps(). It accept state as argument.
- Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's store.dispatch() to implement mapDispatchToProps(). It accepts dispatch as argument.
- mapDispatchToProps() is used to provide specific action creators to react components so that those components can dispatch actions
    agaist the redux store.
- The connect method from react redux, that takes as optional arguments mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps(), maps state and 
    dispatch to props of a react component:
        const connect = ReactRedux.connect;
        const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);
