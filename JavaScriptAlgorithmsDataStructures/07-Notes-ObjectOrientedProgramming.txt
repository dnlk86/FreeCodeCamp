- Real world objects are tangible things people can interact with.
- Objects in JS are used to model real-wold objects. They have properties with certain values and particular behaviors.
- The dot (.) notation used on the objects name followed by the name of the property grants access to the value stored for that property
    (myObj.propName).
- Methods are properties that are functions, those add different behavior to the object.
- Calling properties in object's methods directly with the obj name using the dot notation may cause problems. If the obj name is
    changed, then also the reference to the property inside the method has to be changed. A way to avoid this is by referencig to the
    object using the keyword "this":    this.propName.
- Constructors are functions that create new objects, they define properties and behaviors and do not return a value like a function might.
- Constructors are defined with capitalized names to distinguish them from other functions.
- Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object, this is a reference to the obj that is being created. 
- The "new" operator needs to be used when a constructor is invoked:
    const myDog = new Dog();    // this tell JS to create an instance of the obj Dog and store it in the variable myDog.
- Constructors like every function can accept arguments, so when the constructor is invoked the user can define right away
    the values of some object's properties (without needing to set those properties later with the dot notation).
