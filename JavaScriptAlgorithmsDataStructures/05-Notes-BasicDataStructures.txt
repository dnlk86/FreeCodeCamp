- The array is a data structure, its simplest form is the one-dimensional array, meaning that it only has one level (no nested arrays 
    it only contains other valid JS data types).
- Multi-dimensional arrays ([]) contain other arrays or JS objects ({}).
- The fundamental feature of any data structure is, of course, the ability to not only store data, but to be able to retrieve that 
    data on command. This can be done with the bracket notation and the use of indexes in arrays (zero-indexed) for example.
    Pre-existing data can be also accessed and modified in the same way.
- Arrays are mutable, their content hence their length can be modified. Elements can be added with the methods .unshift() at the front
    and .push() at the end of the array. Both can add multiple elements at the same time.
- In the same way elements can be removed, from the front of the array with the .shift() method or from the end with the .pop() method.
    Both methods return the removed element. Both remove just one element at the time and do not take parameters.
- To remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array there is the method .splice() that takes two parameters,
    the index where to start removing (inclusive) and the number of consecutive elements to remove. The .splice() method both
    modifies the original array and also returns the removed elements in a new array.
